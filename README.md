# Text-Editor 

  ## Description
   I created this application in order to give users a text-editor that can function on the web and offline. It was also built with best practices in mind, with search engine optimization, and accessability features to name a few. One of the best parts is how easy it is to download as well, just simply click the install button on the top left and you should see an option to open/download the app to the right of the url. A challenge I faced was trying to get my webpack to render everything correctly.
